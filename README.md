# About the project

The portfolio is the third, and last project in this IronHack Journey,  made in the ninth week of the Web Developer Bootcamp. This project is a Portfolio Website, that shows a little bit of me and as weel my work during these nine weeks .

In this project i have a getform , that is modern form backend platform that lets you handle your forms on your websites and apps. You can create a form endpoint and start collecting submissions within minutes without having to setup a server or write any backend. Getform is perfect for static sites and works anywhere you can put an HTML form.
